# CgR8s

**CgR8s** is a sample website developed as part of an internship project at **FAG Technologies**. The project showcases a simple yet structured web application, utilising Python (Flask) for the backend and standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the frontend. It serves as a learning and demonstration platform for building scalable and responsive websites.
